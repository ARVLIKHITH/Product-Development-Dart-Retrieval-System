## 1. Starting Point
- **Assignment:** Retrieve darts automatically and return them to the player.  
- **Requirements considered:**  
  - Retrieve 3‚Äì7 darts per round without bending or posture change.  
  - Safe handling (no injury, no dart tip damage).  
  - Accessible for wheelchair users.  
  - Budget < ‚Ç¨200 (prototype level).  
  - Compatible with steel-tip darts.

## 2. Concept Overview (Mode of Operation)

### Detection & Trigger
- **Sensor:** Velostat pressure-sensitive film mounted behind dartboard.  
- **Logic:** Arduino Uno counts impacts, triggers retrieval after 3 darts.  
- **Protection:** Foam ring prevents compression, maintains sensitivity.  

### Control Logic
- Arduino processes sensor signal ‚Üí triggers tilt, electromagnet, buzzer.  
- Outputs: Servo motor (tilt), Electromagnet (assist), Piezo buzzer (feedback).  

### Extraction Mechanism
- **Tilting Board:** Servo/gear motor tilts dartboard 90¬∞ ‚Üí gravity releases darts.  
- **Electromagnet:** Mounted at 90¬∞ to board ‚Üí 2s pulse ‚Üí loosens stuck darts.  

### Return System
- Darts slide onto **angled ramp** ‚Üí pass through **funnel guider** ‚Üí collected in **slot-based foam tray**.  
- Foam padding at impact zones prevents bounce, noise, and damage.  
- Tray slots hold darts individually for safety and ergonomics.  

### Additional Features
- Adjustable ramp height/angle.  
- Audio feedback via buzzer.  
- Emergency stop (mushroom button) halts system instantly.

## 3. Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Hands-free retrieval, no posture change.  
- Faster gameplay flow, user-friendly.  
- Safe design (foam damping, low torque motors).  
- Affordable, modular, and compact.  
- Arduino-based ‚Üí easy to upgrade.  

### Disadvantages
- Magnet reliance ‚Üí may not work with non-metal darts.  
- Ramp angle needs precise calibration.  
- Sensor reliability depends on foam wear/calibration.  
- Slightly complex mechanical synchronization.

## 4. Technical Proofs

### Torque Requirement for Tilt
- Mass of 3 darts = 0.075 kg, distance ~0.15 m.  
- Force ‚âà 0.75 N, torque ‚âà 0.11 Nm.  
- Well within range of standard servo/DC gear motor (<8 Nm capacity in LoR).  

### Ramp Slope Requirement
- Dart mass = 25 g, Œº = 0.2.  
- For sliding: Œ∏ ‚â• 12¬∞.  
- Conclusion: ramp slope > 12¬∞ ensures smooth flow without bounce.

## 8. Conclusion
The **DartXtract** variant demonstrates a **structured, feasible, and safe** dart retrieval system.  
- It retrieves darts automatically in under 15 seconds.  
- Accessible and ergonomic for all players.  
- Built from affordable, widely available components.  
- Minor refinements (sensor robustness, foam durability, magnet alternatives) would improve real-world reliability.  

This variant contributed core elements (magnetic assist + funnel return + safety systems) that were later integrated into the **optimized team solution**.
