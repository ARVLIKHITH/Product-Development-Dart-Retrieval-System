# Dart Retrieval System – Product Development Project (SS25)

This repository documents the **Product Development Project (IBE4, SS25)** at Technische Hochschule Würzburg-Schweinfurt (THWS).  
Our team of 4 students was tasked with designing and prototyping a **Dart Retrieval System** — a mechanism that extracts darts from the dartboard and returns them safely to the player.

---

## Project Objective
- Retrieve darts automatically from the board.  
- Return them to the player without requiring posture change.  
- Ensure safe, reliable, and low-cost operation.  
- Apply structured **product development methodology** from task clarification to prototype.  

---

## Development Process (Guideline-Based)
1. **Task Clarification & Research**  
   - Defined project scope, researched state-of-the-art systems, and identified analogies.  
   - Compiled a **List of Requirements (LoR)** for the system.  

2. **Design Methodology**  
   - Created black box, function structures (hierarchical + dynamic), and morphological box.  
   - Researched potential working principles and technical analogies.  

3. **Concept Race (Variants)**  
   - Each team member developed an **individual variant**.  
   - Variants included different extraction and return mechanisms.  
   - Technical/economic assessment performed using weighted criteria and strength diagrams.  

4. **Optimal Solution**  
   - Selected and optimized the best variant.  
   - Integrated superior sub-solutions from other concepts.  
   - Prepared 3D CAD (Fusion 360) and electronics system (Arduino + L293D driver).  

5. **Prototype & Documentation**  
   - Built physical prototype with extraction, return, and safety features.  
   - Authored **Product Description (manual-style)** covering setup, function, technical data, and maintenance.  
   - Delivered final presentation and project folder.

## System Features
- Automated dart extraction mechanism (motor-driven + funnel return system).  
- Guided tray for safe dart delivery.  
- Electronic control (Arduino) with emergency stop.  
- Visual/audio feedback during operation.  
- Low-cost prototype (budget €200).
